On OSX, if you want to see all the photos in a directory, you have to select
them first, and then invoke `Preview`, instead of opening the first one and then
just pressing arrow keys. To have the desirable behaviour, use `Finder`'s
previewer --- push `Space` on the first file in the directory, then use `Up` and
`Down` arrows to move through the photos.
